# Welcome to ESM-Tools!

ESM-Tools is a modular infrastructure software that allows for seamlessly building and configuration of Earth System Models (ESM) across different High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. 

The ESM-Tools software is developed at the <a href="https://awi.de" target="_blank">Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research</a> in Bremerhaven, jointly with the <a href="https://www.geomar.de/" target="_blank">GEOMAR Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung</a> in Kiel. The software is open-source and distributed through <a href="https://github.com/esm-tools/esm_tools" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Its design follows the separation of concerns principle. It consists of an HPC- and model-agnostic Python back-end and is complemented by modular easy-to-read/write YAML files defining the configuration of each specific component of the system (HPC- and model-configurations).
This allows for a sustainable usage as well as development of the ESM-Tools software. 

ESM-Tools therefore supports sustainable research with Earth System Models and contributes to reproducible research results.


<!--- (DKRZ-Levante, Jülich-Juwels, HLRN-4’s Lise and Emmy, ECMWF-Atos, ICCP-Aleph, etc.). -->


<!--- We currently provide support for AWI's own modelling infrastructure, which encompasses the FESOM Ocean Model, the OpenIFS and ECHAM Atmosphere model, the JSBACH and (coming soon) the LPJ-Guess land vegetation models, the PISM ice sheet model, and the VILMA solid earth model. -->
